<!doctype html>
At the beginning of our code, we put doctype html tag to show that our
code is made by html
<html>
<head>
<title>Little KAISTian's first step </title>
<h5>We can name our own website by using title-tag.
  Also, When we are trying to type korean, we should do charset = "utf-8"
The commands that explains about the information of our site is covered by
  head tag, and the main contents of our website is covered by body tag.
<meta charset = "utf-8">
</head>
<body>
<h1><a href="index.html" target = "_blank"
  title = "this is the main page"> KAISTian's newly website! </a></h1>
<ol>
  <li><a href="about_HTML.html" target = "_blank" title = "topic : html" >HTML
  </a></li>
  <li><a href="about_CSS.html" target = "_blank">CSS</a></li>
  <li><a href="about_JAVAscript.html" target = "_blank">JAVAscript</a></li>
  <li>As you already knew, ol-tag makes ordered-list, ul-tag makes unordered-list
</ol>
<p><strong>strong tag make strongly drawed letters</strong>.
  And <u>u-tag</u> underlines the given part. There are 6 head tags,
  namely <h1>This is header h1 </h1>, <h2> THis is header 2 </h2>, and so
  on until we reach to <h6> the smallest header h6. </h6> </p>
Instead of p-tag for making several paragraphs, we can also use br tags, and
since we can freely make new lines, <br><br><br> it will be better to get used
to the br tags.

One thing is that we can use CSS language to cover up p-tags. Like using
<p style = "margin-top:45px;"> "p style = "margin-top:45px;"". <br>
<br>
Then, how to attach images? Use img-tag with image source!<br><br>
<img src = "https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1602891989804-bebf90
58e1b7?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&auto=format&fit=crop&w=1600&q=60" width = "40%" >
<p style = "margin-top:45px;">
Good! Now,let's see how to attach some links.
Now, use a-tag with href containing the domain of the target link.
Then,use target = "_blank" to make the link open the given site, and
use title to show up the usage through tooltips.
<a href="https://kaist.ac.kr/" target="_blank" title="my great university">
This will be the link for the main homepage of my university </a>
</body>
<p style = "margin-top:45px;">
Lastly, we envelope all head part and body part by using html tags.
